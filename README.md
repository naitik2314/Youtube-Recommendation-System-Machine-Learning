Ever wondered how on Earth does Youtube recommendation system work so well, worry no! Naitik Shah on the saviour.
Well YouTube has a lot of data to train on, and have computers capable of providing computalional power to the whole city you are living in, but this code is basic, and shows the basics on how the recommendation works!
Would love to see your work, and don't forget to star the repo.
